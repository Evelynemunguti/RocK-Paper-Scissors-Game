# RocK-Paper-Scissors-Game
This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game built using JavaScript. It runs in the console and allows a player to compete against a randomly generated computer choice.

The player selects Rock, Paper or Scissors and the computer randomly picks one of the three choices.

The winner is determined based on the rules:

Rock beats Scissors 

Scissors beats Paper 

Paper beats Rock

If both the player and the computer choose the same option, it's a tie.
